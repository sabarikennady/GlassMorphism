# GlassMorphism React Native App

This project demonstrates a **React Native** app implementing a **Glassmorphism effect** across multiple screens, showcasing a visually appealing UI with frosted glass-like elements. The app contains several screens, each designed with a different focus while maintaining the glassmorphism theme.

## What is Glassmorphism?

**Glassmorphism** is a design trend that revolves around creating a frosted glass-like effect, typically characterized by:

- **Blurry backgrounds**: The background is blurred behind a semi-transparent, frosted glass-like surface.
- **Vibrant colors**: Transparent surfaces are often layered on colorful or dynamic backgrounds to create visual contrast.
- **Smooth, modern feel**: This effect gives a sleek, polished, and contemporary look to user interfaces.

Glassmorphism is often used in modern web and mobile apps to give them a soft, translucent, and futuristic feel, making the UI feel less static and more fluid.
